# Use one of the following formats for 'caseid'
#    caseid: '001'
#    caseid: ['001', '002', '003']
#    caseid:
#       - '001'
#       - '002'
#       - '003'
#    caseid: ./caselist-controls.txt  # The '/' tells pipe that this is a file
#
# Note that you need to wrap your caseid in quotes if it is an integer like
# above, otherwise the yaml reader will read them as 1, 2, 3, etc. instead of
# '001', '002', '003'.
#
# The values for keys like dwiKey come from the names in inputPaths.yml. For
# example,
#    dwiKey: ['dwiharmonized', 'dwi']
# means that the pipeline will be run for the filepaths of 'dwiharmonized' and
# 'dwi' in inputPaths.yml (caseid will automatically be substituted). These are
# meant to be descriptive names that describe your input paths and are used in
# naming the generated output.

caseid: [./caselist.txt]
inputKey: ['dwi']
param2: ['p2a', 'p2b']
param3: ['p3a']
