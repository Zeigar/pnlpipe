* BUG: deleting files then running gives "node does not have attribute db"
* STy: add keys subcommand
* replace ConvertBetweenFileFormat calls with allowLossyConversion in DWIConvert
* move atlas.py root flags to subcommands (otherwise help doesn't work)
* show params with meaning in filenames
* add permutation check to bse.py (currently assumes correct dwi permutation)
* make env command have symlinks option
* add env.sh files to software modules
* make file argument non-list in caseid field of params config file
* BUG: symlink: don't skip symlinks, remake them
* software envs need to raise an exception if their paths don't exist, e.g could
  be deleted during pipeline run
* ENH: add check for correct DWI axes permutation
* ENH: add ukf params
* STY: change pnlscripts.util to pnlscripts
* ENH: add isUpToDate function (right now assumes dependencies don't changed between runs, which is true for pnl pipeline but not generally)
* think about multi file nodes
* STY: add log file output to pnlscripts scripts
* STY: use python logging correctly
* sty: clarify when 'caseid' gets special treatment as a parameter
