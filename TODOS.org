* add paths.yml for generated
* add isUpToDate function (right now assumes dependencies don't changed between runs, which is true for pnl pipeline but not generally)
* factor out pnl specific code from pipelinelib
* think about multi file nodes
* add logging to pnlscripts scripts
* add ncurses interface to makepathsyml.py
* add HCP preprocessing pipeline if we decide to use it
