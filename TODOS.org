* ENH: make bse.py operate on niftis
- then FsInDwi doens't need to convert to nrrd first
* BUG: decide on getPath behaviour - no exceptions, check paths before run?
* ENH: add list of default targets
* STY: software: if building  master, don't say building '...-master'
* STY/ENH: add env.sh to software builds
* STY: ls symlinks will print existing full paths, but symlink might not exist
* STy: add keys subcommand
* replace ConvertBetweenFileFormat calls with allowLossyConversion in DWIConvert
* move atlas.py root flags to subcommands (otherwise help doesn't work)
- as well as fs2dwi.py
* show params with meaning in filenames
* add permutation check to bse.py (currently assumes correct dwi permutation)
* make env command have symlinks option
* add env.sh files to software modules
* make file argument non-list in caseid field of params config file
* BUG: symlink: don't skip symlinks, remake them
* software envs need to raise an exception if their paths don't exist, e.g could
  be deleted during pipeline run
* ENH: add check for correct DWI axes permutation
* ENH: add ukf params
* STY: change pnlscripts.util to pnlscripts
* ENH: add isUpToDate function (right now assumes dependencies don't changed between runs, which is true for pnl pipeline but not generally)
* think about multi file nodes
  - could make it polymorphic: dictionary, list, string
* STY: add log file output to pnlscripts scripts
* STY: use python logging correctly
* sty: clarify when 'caseid' gets special treatment as a parameter
