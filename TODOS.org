#+PROPERTY

* Test
** ENH: make bse.py operate on niftis
 - then FsInDwi doens't need to convert to nrrd first as well as fs2dwi.py
** add antsJointFusion
** move atlas.py root flags to subcommands (otherwise help doesn't work)
** ENH: add ukf params
* Todo
** add keep going flag
** add --missing flag to ls
** add validators to pipeline (e.g. dwi validator/nrrdchecker)
** add caseid flag to env/make
** ENH: add list of default targets
** STY: software: if building  master, don't say building '...-master'
** STY: ls symlinks will print existing full paths, but symlink might not exist
** STy: add keys subcommand
** replace ConvertBetweenFileFormat calls with allowLossyConversion in DWIConvert
** show params with meaning in filenames
** add permutation check to bse.py (currently assumes correct dwi permutation)
** add env.sh files to software modules
** make file argument non-list in caseid field of params config file
** BUG: symlink: don't skip symlinks, remake them
** software envs need to raise an exception if their paths don't exist, e.g could
   be deleted during pipeline run
** ENH: add check for correct DWI axes permutation
** STY: change pnlscripts.util to pnlscripts
** ENH: add isUpToDate function (right now assumes dependencies don't changed between runs, which is true for pnl pipeline but not generally)
** think about multi file nodes
   - could make it polymorphic: dictionary, list, string
** STY: add log file output to pnlscripts scripts
** sty: clarify when 'caseid' gets special treatment as a parameter
